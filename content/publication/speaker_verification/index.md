abstract: We implemented deep speaker embedding for speaker verification with a domain loss to alleviate the languages mismatch problem. The performance of the ECAPA-TDNN (pre-trained using the English dataset) on the unlabelled Chinese dataset has improved by 10% with the MMD-based domain loss. This project has won the Honours Project - Technical Excellence Award.
